    Sample Model
    Ren Foster - PRO

============================================================

    This model focuses on learning expressions that use the rich drawing features introduced in Cubism 5.3.
    It serves as a reference for using features such as alpha blend for creating masks flexibly, 
    and offscreen drawing for displaying semi-transparency cleanly by drawing multiple objects together.
    It is designed for use in environments with sufficient machine specifications,
    such as video streaming on a PC using tracking software like nizima LIVE.
